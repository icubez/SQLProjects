Create Report Showing by year: total, max, min, and average salary
• Exclude Managers from Report
• Managers are defined in the table DEPT_MANAGER
• Don’t worry about active dates at this time.
• Hint use NOT IN clause


			:::Solution 1:::

         
    

    SELECT 
    current_year, SUM(sal), MAX(sal), MIN(sal), AVG(sal)
FROM
    (SELECT 
        salary AS sal, DATE_FORMAT(from_date, '%Y') AS Current_Year
    FROM
        salaries
    WHERE
        emp_no NOT IN (111877 , 111784, 111692, 111534, 111400, 111133, 111035, 110854, 110800, 110765, 110725, 110567, 110511, 110420, 110386, 110344, 110303, 110228, 110183, 110114, 110085, 110039, 110022)) salaries
GROUP BY current_year;


			:::Solution 2:::
    

SELECT 
    date_format(from_date, '%Y') as salary_year,
    sum(salary) as sum_salary,
    max(salary) as max_salary,
    min(salary) as min_salary,
    avg(salary) as avg_salary
FROM
    salaries
WHERE
    emp_no NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT
            emp_no
        FROM
            dept_manager) group by salary_year;

Similar to Department Manager Report, but use table DEPT_EMP instead.
• Report should show:
• Department Name, First Name, Last Name, and Title
• Limit to active assignment to Department
• Limit to active assignment to Title
• Order by Department, Last Name

			:::Solution 1:::


 SELECT 
    dept_name, first_name, last_name, title
FROM
    dept_emp AS de
        JOIN
    employees AS emp ON emp.emp_no = de.emp_no
        JOIN
    departments AS dev ON dev.dept_no = de.dept_no
        JOIN
    titles AS T ON T.emp_no = emp.emp_no
WHERE
    dev.dept_no = 'd009'
        AND T.to_date = '9999-01-01'
ORDER BY dept_name , last_name;

   

				:::Project Sample:::
        
• Using a LEFT outer join create a report to show employees without a current title
• Titles are in the titles table
• Current titles have a to_date equal to ‘9999-01-01’
• Write a NOT IN statement first to help you visualize the query



				:::Solution 1:::

Write a Not In statement first to help visualize the query 

Below I used the Not equal to statement to filter out the titles with to_date = ‘9999-01-01’

SELECT * FROM TITLES
WHERE TO_DATE <> '9999-01-01';

Now to the solution we can simple add the above in the 'where' clause

SELECT 
   TITLE, FROM_DATE, TO_DATE, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM
    EMPLOYEES AS EMP
        LEFT OUTER JOIN
    TITLES AS T ON T.EMP_NO = EMP.EMP_NO
WHERE
    TO_DATE <> '9999-01-01'
ORDER BY FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME;

				:::Solution 1:::

Alternatively we can use the not in statement 

SELECT 
    *
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    emp_no NOT IN (SELECT 
            emp_no
        FROM
            titles
        WHERE
            to_date = '9999-01-01');

And the solution 

SELECT 
    TITLE, FROM_DATE, TO_DATE, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME
FROM
    employees AS emp
        LEFT OUTER JOIN
    titles AS t ON t.emp_no = emp.emp_no
WHERE
    to_date NOT IN (SELECT 
            to_date
        FROM
            titles
        WHERE
            to_date = '9999-01-01')
ORDER BY first_name , last_name;

-- CHECK : THE OUTPUT OF FIRST SOLUTION AND SECOND SOLUTION ARE SAME, VERIFY THAT THE DATE '9999-01-01' DOES NOT APPEAR
